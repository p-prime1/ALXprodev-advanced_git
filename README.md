Project Overview
Git-Flow is a branching model for Git, proposed by Vincent Driessen, that helps developers manage features, releases, and hotfixes in a consistent and scalable way. It introduces well-defined roles for branches and helps teams coordinate code changes more effectively. Git-Flow is particularly beneficial for large-scale projects where multiple developers work simultaneously on various aspects of the codebase.

Git-Flow revolves around five primary branch types:

main (or master) – production-ready code
develop – ongoing development
feature/* – new features in progress
release/* – preparation for production releases
hotfix/* – critical bug fixes on the main branch
